First install any I2P router unless you already have any.
In case if i2pd, here is example of working i2pd.conf file:

#Begin-of-file
bandwidth=X
tunconf = /usr/local/etc/tunnels.conf

[httpproxy]
address=127.0.0.1
port=4444

[addressbook]
defaulturl = http://joajgazyztfssty4w2on5oaqksz6tqoxbduy553y34mf4byv6gpq.b32.i2p/export/alive-hosts.txt
#End-of-file

To use Subversion client (svn) create I2P tunnel for tcp/3690 and destination
4cyirqnjw4lsm6tml4e5cgt5wk7o3rexa5zuaes5lwjck4hyepia.b32.i2p

In case of i2pd, here are 6 lines for your tunnels.conf:

[zapret-info]
type = client
address = 127.0.0.1
port = 3690
destination = 4cyirqnjw4lsm6tml4e5cgt5wk7o3rexa5zuaes5lwjck4hyepia.b32.i2p
destinationport = 3690

Due to I2P access slowness, recommended way to initial checkout is the following:

svn checkout --depth=empty svn://127.0.0.1/z-i z-i # first time only
cd z-i
svn update dump.csv

Replace 127.0.0.1 with your I2P entry address if you have it elsewhere.

Initial update may take long time despite of traffic compression
by Subversion server. You can monitor progress of initial update
looking at size of temporary file in the z-i/.svn/tmp directory.

Consecutive updates should be significantly faster because they are differential.
